                The boundary between simulation and reality is dissolving. As we transition from rasterized graphics to
                neural rendering, the dream of a persistent, infinite virtual world is finally becoming an engineering
                problem we can solve.

                "People come to the OASIS for all the things they can do, but they stay for all the things they can be."
                — James Halliday
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../images/anorak.jpg" alt="Anorak the All-Knowing">
                <figcaption>James Halliday's avatar, Anorak.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>The Dream of Anorak</h2>

            <p>
                My obsession didn't start with a research paper or a frantic GitHub commit. It started in the dark of a
                movie theater, watching a scene that would imprint itself on my mind forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                I watched <strong>James Halliday</strong> (the eccentric genius played by Mark Rylance) leave behind a
                message for the world. He wasn't just a game designer; he was an architect of a new reality. He had
                built the <strong>OASIS</strong>—a place where the laws of physics were optional, where identity was
                fluid, and where the world was not a finite rock in space but an unbounded, persistent manifold of
                digital possibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I sat there, watching his avatar <strong>Anorak</strong> hand over the keys to his kingdom, I felt a
                specific, burning curiosity. Not the passive enjoyment of a moviegoer, but the frantic,
                reverse-engineering mindset of a builder. I didn't just want to <em>play</em> in the Oasis. <strong>I
                    wanted to build the engine that ran it.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                For years, this dream felt painfully out of reach. The industry was stuck in the "Rasterization
                Age"—building rigid meshes, baking static lightmaps, and scripting limited interactions. We were
                simulating the <em>appearance</em> of a world, not the world itself. Then came the "Generative Age" with
                models like Sora, where we could hallucinate beautiful dreams, but like dreams, they dissolved the
                moment you tried to touch them. A chair might turn into a table; a door might lead nowhere. It was
                visually stunning, but physically hollow.
            </p>
            <p>
                But today, something has shifted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "March of Nines" has brought us to the threshold of a new era. We are finally graduating from
                hallucinating pixels to <strong>simulating states</strong>. We are swapping out the black-box neural
                networks of the past for a differentiable, action-conditioned <strong>Gaussian substrate</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are building the <strong>Bare-Metal Reality Engine</strong>. And for the first time, I believe we
                have the blueprints for Halliday's masterpiece.
            </p>

            <h2>The Substrate of Reality</h2>

            <p>
                To understand why this moment is different, we have to look at the "atoms" of our digital world. In
                traditional games, the world was made of triangles—rigid, sharp, and hard to update. Then we tried
                <strong>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)</strong>, which were like holograms: beautiful to look at, but
                you couldn't touch them. They were ghosts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)</strong> changed everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think of 3D Gaussians as "fuzzy atoms." Each one has a position, a shape, an opacity, and a color.
                Unlike triangles, they differenitable—meaning we can train them with gradient descent. Unlike NeRFs,
                they are explicit—meaning we can reach into the cloud and move them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the new <strong>Gaussian World Model (GWM)</strong> framework, we aren't just predicting the next
                frame of a video. We are predicting the <em>flow</em> of these atoms. When you push a door in the neural
                Oasis, the model predicts the trajectory of thousands of Gaussians, updating their state in real-time to
                simulate collision, friction, and mass. This isn't a video recording; it's a physics simulation learned
                entirely from data. It is the "Matter" of the Oasis.
            </p>

            <h2>The Architects of the Simulation</h2>

            <p>
                Just as the Oasis had Gunter clans and IOI corporations vying for control, the race to build this
                Reality Engine is being driven by three distinct research frontiers. My work involves synthesizing these
                streams into a coherent architecture—the "Anorak Engine."
            </p>
            <p>
                First, we have <strong>The Spatialists</strong> at <strong>World Labs</strong>. They are solving the
                problem of <em>Place</em>. Their models, like <strong>RTFM</strong>, introduce the concept of "Spatial
                Memory." In a standard video generator, the world is ephemeral; if you spin around, the room behind you
                changes. RTFM assigns a 3D Pose to every frame, ensuring that the world persists in memory even when
                unobserved. This is the foundation of digital geography.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, <strong>The Reasoners</strong> at <strong>Meta FAIR</strong> are solving the problem of
                <em>Laws</em>. Yann LeCun's <strong>V-JEPA</strong> architecture functions as the "physics engine" of
                the simulation. It teaches the AI common sense—understanding the latent causal link between "fragile
                object" and "hard surface." It ensures the simulation obeys a consistent set of rules, preventing the
                "dream logic" that plagues current generative models.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, <strong>The Scalers</strong> at <strong>Google DeepMind</strong> are solving the problem of
                <em>Interface</em>. With <strong>Genie 3</strong>, they demonstrated that internet-scale video can be
                converted into a playable, interactive environment. This is the <strong>Latent Action
                    Interface</strong>—allowing us to control the simulation not with text prompts, but with pure
                intent. It is the precursor to the haptic interface of the future.
            </p>

            <h2>Engineering the Unbounded Manifold</h2>

            <p>
                So, how do we put this together? How do we build the 'Oasis' as Halliday envisioned it: an unbounded
                manifold where infinite procedural detail and multi-agent causality emerge natively? This is the
                engineering challenge I have dedicated my career to.
            </p>

            <h3>The Infinite Detail Problem: Neural Proceduralism</h3>
            <p>
                We cannot design every planet in the Oasis by hand. We need <strong>Neural Proceduralism</strong>. We
                need models like <strong>WorldGrow</strong>, which use "Structured Latents" to grow the world on demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine walking through a forest. The trees directly in front of you are rendered as high-fidelity 3D
                Gaussians (Near-Field). The forest in the distance exists only as compressed latent vectors
                (Far-Field)—a "dream" of a forest. As you walk forward, the Reality Engine "inflates" the dream into
                atoms, resolving the branches and leaves just before your photon receptors can register them. This is
                the only way to scale to the size of a universe.
            </p>

            <h3>The Causality Problem: The Distributed Ledger of Physics</h3>
            <p>
                The Oasis is shared. If I carve my name into a tree, you must see it 100 years later. We solve this with
                <strong>Decentralized Gaussian Fusion</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't send video frames across the network. We send <strong>Delta-Updates</strong> to the Gaussian
                Cloud. If I push a box, I am broadcasting a force vector. The server calculates the deformation, updates
                the Gaussian Covariance Matrices, and syncs the new state to you. It is a distributed ledger, but
                instead of financial transactions, it records the history of physical interactions.
            </p>

                <figcaption>"I created the OASIS because I never felt at home in the real world."</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>The Invisible Key</h2>

            <p>
                In the end, Halliday didn't build the Oasis just to escape reality. He built it to find a way to
                connect.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are building the most powerful connection engine in human history. A place where distance is
                irrelevant, where potential is unlimited, and where the digital world feels as warm, heavy, and
                consequential as the physical one.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "Oasis" isn't going to be a piece of software you install. It’s going to be a <strong>persistent
                    neural state</strong>—a massive, high-dimensional manifold that we inhabit together.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every line of code I write, every paper I simulate, brings us one step closer to that moment when the
                pixels stop flickering and the world becomes solid. The moment when we find the first Key.
            </p>
            <p>
                The simulation is loading. See you on the leaderboard.
