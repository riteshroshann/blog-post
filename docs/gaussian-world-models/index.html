                <strong>Abstract:</strong> The trajectory of artificial intelligence has arrived at a critical
                inflection point, marking the end of the era of passive observation ("hallucinating pixels") and the
                beginning of the era of active simulation ("simulating states"). This report analyzes the convergence of
                3D Gaussian Splatting, Diffusion Transformers, and Joint-Embedding Architectures to engineer a
                "Bare-Metal Reality Engine." We explore the necessary steps to construct an unbounded, persistent, and
                multi-agent virtual manifold—the "Oasis"—where infinite procedural detail emerges natively from a
                persistent neural state.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Introduction: The Transition from Hallucination to Simulation</h2>
            <p>
                For the past decade, the dominant paradigm in generative modeling has been the prediction of
                pixels—training massive neural networks to minimize reconstruction error on static images or video
                clips. This approach, epitomized by Large Language Models (LLMs) and video diffusion models like
                OpenAI’s Sora, has yielded systems capable of "hallucinating" convincing visual textures. However, these
                systems remain fundamentally disconnected from the physical reality they depict. They are spectators,
                predicting the next frame of a movie without understanding the underlying mechanics of the set.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are now witnessing the emergence of a new paradigm: <strong>simulating states</strong>. This shift is
                driven by the realization that true intelligence—specifically Spatial Intelligence—requires an internal
                model of the world that is persistent, causal, and actionable. We are graduating from predicting how
                light hits a camera sensor to simulating how objects occupy space and interact with forces. This is the
                transition from "hallucinating pixels" to constructing a <strong>Gaussian World Model (GWM)</strong>—a
                differentiable, action-conditioned substrate that functions as a bare-metal reality engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of the "Oasis"—an unbounded, persistent, and multi-agent virtual manifold—requires an
                architecture that supports:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Infinite Procedural Detail:</strong> A user can walk forever without the world dissolving
                    into noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Agent Causality:</strong> The actions of one agent permanently alter the state for all
                    others.</li>
                <li><strong>Native Physics:</strong> Gravity and collision are not merely visual effects but emergent
                    properties of the neural state.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Theoretical Foundations of Spatial Intelligence</h2>
            <p>
                To understand why the industry is pivoting toward world models, we must first diagnose the limitations
                of the current "generative" paradigm and define the requirements of Spatial Intelligence.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 The Hallucination Trap</h3>
            <p>
                Current state-of-the-art video generation models operate in pixel space (or a compressed latent pixel
                space). They predict the transport of light, not the state of matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Physics Hallucination:</strong> These models often fail basic causal checks. A glass falling off
                a table might melt into the floor rather than shatter, or a bite taken out of a cookie might disappear
                in subsequent frames. These errors occur because the model minimizes visual divergence from its training
                data (movies), not physical divergence from reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>The Spectator Constraint:</strong> Crucially, these models are trained on passive video. They
                learn what happens (correlation), not what happens if (causality). They cannot reliably answer
                counterfactuals: "What if I push this cup?" A true simulator must be action-conditioned, allowing an
                agent to intervene in the causal chain.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 The "World Model" Dogma</h3>
            <p>
                Yann LeCun at Meta FAIR has long argued that the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) lies in
                World Models. He posits that LLMs are "off-ramps" on the highway to AGI because they model the
                statistical structure of language, which is a low-bandwidth compression of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                A World Model is a system that predicts the state of the world at time <em>t+1</em> given the state at
                time <em>t</em> and an action <em>a<sub>t</sub></em>. This prediction should happen in an abstract
                latent space that discards irrelevant details to focus on relevant dynamics.
            </p>

            <h2>3. The Substrate: 3D Gaussian Splatting as Digital Matter</h2>
            <p>
                If we are to build a "bare-metal reality engine," we need a data structure to represent the world.
                Meshes (triangles) are rigid and difficult for neural networks to modify. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
                are continuous but computationally expensive. <strong>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)</strong> has emerged
                as the ideal substrate for the Neural Oasis.
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Explicit vs. Implicit Representations</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike the implicit nature of NeRFs (which are like a "hologram" that exists only when observed), 3D
                Gaussians represent the scene as a cloud of anisotropic particles. Each Gaussian is defined by Position,
                Covariance (shape), Opacity, and Color (Spherical Harmonics).
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Differentiable Rasterization as Physics</h3>
            <p>
                The "killer feature" of 3DGS is its differentiable rasterizer. This allows a neural network to render an
                image from the Gaussians, compare it to a target, and backpropagate the error directly to the Gaussian
                parameters.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "This effectively turns the rendering engine into a differentiable physics engine."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                If a network wants to simulate a robot pushing a block, it doesn't need to learn friction equations; it
                learns to update the positions and rotations of the block's Gaussians such that the rendered outcome
                matches reality.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Architectural Deep Dive: The Neural Simulator</h2>
            <p>
                The first rigorous implementations of Gaussian World Models come from the robotics and autonomous
                driving communities.
            </p>
            <h3>4.1 GWM: The Neural Simulator for Manipulation</h3>
            <p>
                The paper "GWM: Towards Scalable Gaussian World Models for Robotic Manipulation" (Lu et al., 2025)
                presents a canonical architecture. At its heart is a <strong>Latent Diffusion Transformer
                    (DiT)</strong>. Unlike standard DiTs that generate images, this one acts as a dynamics model.
            </p>
            <p>
                It takes the current latent state and the robot's action, and predicts the next latent state. This
                explicitly causal link ensures the world evolves because of the agent, not just temporally.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 GaussianWorld: 4D Occupancy Forecasting</h3>
            <p>
                GaussianWorld (Zuo et al., CVPR 2025) adapts this to the unbounded, streaming nature of autonomous
                driving. It reformulates prediction as <strong>4D Occupancy Forecasting</strong>, decomposing the
                problem into Ego-Motion Alignment, Dynamic Object Movement, and Completion of Newly Observed Areas. This
                ensures the "world model" is a continuous, running process, not a discrete generation task—a critical
                requirement for the Oasis.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Engineering Types: The World Builders</h2>
            <p>
                While roboticists focus on manipulation, teams like World Labs are tackling World Building.
            </p>

            <h3>5.1 Marble and RTFM</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Marble</strong> is the "architect"—decoupling coarse structure from style to allow for "world
                expansion," effectively inpainting the void at the boundary of a scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>RTFM (Real-Time Frame Model)</strong> is the "renderer." It solves the drift problem via
                "Context Juggling" and Spatial Memory. By assigning a 3D Pose to every generated frame, it treats frames
                as spatial memory, querying relevant past data to maintain consistency even as the user rotates 360
                degrees.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 "The Matrix": Infinite-Horizon Generation</h3>
            <p>
                The goal is infinite generation. The paper "The Matrix" introduces the <strong>Shift-Window Denoising
                    Process Model (Swin-DPM)</strong>. It ensures that the model always has a coherent "local history"
                to condition on, allowing it to extrapolate infinitely without diverging into noise.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Blueprint for The Oasis</h2>
            <p>
                The user asks: "How do we engineer the 'Oasis'... where infinite procedural detail and multi-agent
                causality aren't just simulated, but emerge natively?"
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the research analyzed, we propose the following blueprint: mechanism.
            </p>

            <h3>6.1 The Multi-Agent Alignment Problem: GauDP</h3>
            <p>
                In a multi-agent world, subjective realities must align. <strong>GauDP (2025)</strong> proposes a
                Decentralized-to-Centralized architecture where local Gaussian fields are fused into a specific Globally
                Consistent 3D Gaussian Field. The "Server" of the Oasis stores this Global Manifold, and clients act as
                "updaters" ($\Delta G$).
            </p>

            <h3>6.2 Enforcing Logic: CausalStruct</h3>
            <p>
                To prevent hallucinations like floating tables, we need a Logic Layer. <strong>CausalStruct</strong>
                integrates LLMs to construct a causal scene graph (e.g., Cup --supported_by--> Table). If the physics
                engine predicts a violation, the logic layer intervenes, ensuring Logical Causality.
            </p>

            <h3>6.3 Infinite Persistence: The "Neural Server"</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Near Field:</strong> Exploring explicit, high-fidelity 3D Gaussians for precise interaction.
                <br>
                <strong>Far Field:</strong> The distant world exists as Structured Latents (SLATs)—compressed neural
                potentials.
                <br>
                <strong>The Juggler:</strong> As the user moves, the server dynamically expands Far Field latents into
                Near Field Gaussians.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Conclusion: The Bare-Metal Reality Engine</h2>
            <p>
                We have moved beyond the "hallucinating pixels" era. The research from World Labs, DeepMind, Meta, and
                the robotics community points to a unified future:

            </ul>
            <p>
                The engineering of the "Oasis" is no longer a question of <em>if</em>, but <em>how efficiently</em> we
                can run these models. The Oasis will not be built by hand; it will be grown from a persistent neural
                state, nurtured by the causal interactions of its inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are building the Bare-Metal Reality Engine.
