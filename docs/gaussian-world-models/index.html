                The Dream of Anorak</h2>

            <p>
                Like many of us who work in deep learning and graphics, my journey didn't start with a research paper.
                It started with a movie. When I watched <em>Ready Player One</em>, I was captivated not just by the
                spectacle, but by the sheer audacity of the <strong>Oasis</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea that <strong>James Halliday</strong> (aka Anorak) could engineer a universe—an unbounded,
                persistent, and multi-agent manifold where the only limit is your imagination—has been the "North Star"
                of my curiosity. It has been my dream project, the driving force behind my research, and the reason I
                spend my nights debugging CUDA kernels.
            </p>
            <p>
                For years, the Oasis felt like pure fiction. We were stuck "hallucinating pixels"—drawing pretty 2D
                pictures of 3D worlds. But recently, something shifted. The technology has finally caught up to the
                dream.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are graduating from making movies to building the <strong>Bare-Metal Reality Engine</strong>. And I
                believe <strong>Gaussian World Models</strong> are the key to unlocking Halliday's vision.
            </p>

            <h3>The March of Nines: Beyond Hallucination</h3>
            <p>
                For the last few years, the AI field has been living in a fever dream. Models like Sora could paint a
                beautiful video of a cat, but if that cat walked behind a chair, the world melted. The physics were just
                a suggestion. We were training the "visual cortex" of the AI without giving it a "cerebellum."
            </p>
            <p>
                To build the Oasis, we need more than just pixels. We need <strong>simulation</strong>. We need a world
                that exists even when no one is looking at it.
            </p>

            <h3>The Substrate: Why 3D Gaussians?</h3>
            <p>
                This is where <strong>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)</strong> changes everything. Think of these as the
                "atoms" of our new reality. Unlike old methods that were heavy and slow, Gaussians are explicit,
                differentiable, and fast.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the new <strong>Gaussian World Model (GWM)</strong> framework, we don't just predict the next frame
                of a video. We predict how these "atoms" move in response to physics and action. It is the bridge
                between a static game engine and a generative dream.
            </p>

            <h3>The Lit Review: Who is building the "Oasis"?</h3>
            <p>
                My research has led me to track three distinct groups who are essentially building the components of
                Halliday's engine right now:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Spatialists (World Labs):</strong> Under Fei-Fei Li, they are solving the "Map" of the
                    Oasis. Their <strong>RTFM</strong> model treats frames as "Spatial Memory," allowing the world to be
                    persistent.</li>
                <li><strong>The Reasoners (Meta FAIR):</strong> Yann LeCun is teaching the Oasis "Common Sense." His
                    <strong>V-JEPA</strong> architecture ensures that the simulation obeys causal logic, not just visual
                    trends.</li>
                <li><strong>The Scalers (Google DeepMind):</strong> DeepMind's <strong>Genie 3</strong> is showing us
                    how to scale this up, turning internet video into a playable, interactive environment.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Engineering My Dream: The Unbounded Manifold</h3>
            <p>
                So, how do we actually build it? How do we engineer the Oasis where detail and causality emerge
                natively?
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the problem I am obsessed with finding the answer to.
            </p>

            <h4>1. Infinite Procedural Detail</h4>
            <p>
                We simply cannot store a planetary-scale Oasis in memory. We need <strong>Neural Proceduralism</strong>.
                Using "Structured Latents," we can grow the world only where the observer is looking. It’s like the
                "Far-Field" is a low-dimensional dream, and the "Near-Field" is a high-fidelity Gaussian reality.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Multi-Agent Causality</h4>
            <p>
                In a shared world, if I break a window, you must see the shards. We are moving toward
                <strong>Decentralized Gaussian Fusion</strong>. Instead of a central server, we sync the *changes* to
                the neural atoms. Causality becomes a distributed consensus problem.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion: Ready Player One?</h3>
            <p>
                We are still in the early innings. But for the first time, I can see the path. The "Oasis" isn't going
                to be a piece of software written in C++. It’s going to be a <strong>persistent neural state</strong>—a
                massive, high-dimensional manifold that we "poke" with actions and "observe" with differentiable
                renderers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the project I have been waiting for. The March of Nines is underway, and I am endlessly awaiting
                the day we finally step through the screen.
            </p>
